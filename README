Release 3.0, Apr 29, 2014

This directory contains Matlab codes for fast grid rotation method on
a sphere.  The algorithm contructs a set of grids, obtained by rotating
the original grid by nphi uniformly spaced angles phi.

This release contains optional calls to the nonuniform FFT in two
dimensions for testing/timing purposes, and should handle odd number
of nphi in the initial grid correctly. The naming of routines has been
slightly changed, the main routines now have the 'rotgrid' prefix.

rotgrid_ref_cmpl.m requires optimized shiftphase.m routines, 
but it is easy to switch to regular Matlab by uncommenting 
several lines above the shiftphase call.

====

To run a simple test, please type

'octave test_rotgrid.m'

from the command line or

'test_rotgrid' 

in Matlab


The output should look as:

nphi =  30
ntheta =  30
nphi1 =  30
ntheta1 =  15
nrot =  450
Elapsed time is 0.01083 seconds.
